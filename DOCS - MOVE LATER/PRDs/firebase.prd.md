# GymTracker Pro - Firebase Authentication PRD

## 1. Overview

### 1.1 Product Vision

Integrate Firebase Authentication into the GymTracker Pro application to enable secure user account creation, cross-device synchronization, and persistent user data storage. This foundation will support the premium subscription model while ensuring free users can continue using local storage functionality.

### 1.2 Target Users

- Fitness enthusiasts who use multiple devices
- Gym-goers who want to track their progress long-term
- Users who want to secure and back up their fitness data
- Premium subscribers who expect their subscription to persist across devices

### 1.3 Success Metrics

- 70%+ of new users complete the account creation process
- 80%+ of returning users successfully log in
- Reduce churn rate by 15% through improved data persistence
- Increase premium conversion rate by 10% through enhanced features

## 2. User Flows

### 2.1 First-Time User Experience

1. User opens the app for the first time
2. App displays splash screen followed by a welcome screen
3. User is presented with options to:
